# Label AI

_Simple web app using AI to OCR and parse herbarium specimen labels_

This script provides a simple HTML UI to access the
[EdenAI](https://www.edenai.co/) APIs. It uses: i) Google to OCR an
image (deals with handwriting well), ii) (optionally) Google to
translate the OCR text into English, and iii) OpenAIâ€™s Generative Text
AI (related to ChatGPT) to parse the OCR into Darwin-Core-ish fields.
These are loaded into a HTML form where they can be edited. Finally, a
tab-delimited text string can copied and pasted into text editor and
opened by a spreadsheet/DB.

As input, the app can either take a ID (e.g., a Museum accession
number) and use a lookup table from IDs to Image URLs, or a
directly uploaded image.  The former permits the app to be run on a
local machine. Using the latter requires a public webserver with
server write-permission to a directory in which the uploaded images
are stored.

**Note**: If you put this app on a public server, and do not want to
subsidize the public with your payments to EdenAI, use Basic
Authentication to password protect the site.

## Installation

_This script is a quick hack and you might do better to rewrite
something similar with your platform of choice. But it does work._

 * Dependencies: **Gawk** and
   [gawkextlib](https://gawkextlib.sourceforge.net/), with the Json
   extension. On Arch Linux, packages `gawk`, `gawkextlib` (AUR) and
   `gawk-json` (AUR). Plus an HTTP **web server**, e.g., Apache.
 * Clone the repo somewhere the web server can see and execute the
   directory
 * `$ cp .htaccess.template .htaccess`
 * If using Basic Authentication, create a password file with `htpasswd`
 * Edit `.htaccess` as needed (e.g., to set password file or disable Auth)
 * Get an EdenAI account and API key
 * `$ cp pw_template.awk pw.awk`
 * Add the API key to `pw.awk`, and the _relative_ path of a
   web-readable, server-writable directory where the uploaded images
   can be stored.
 * Make that directory: `$ mkdir ../aiimg && chmod a+w ../aiimg`
   (`../aiimg` is an example)
 * (optionally) Create a space-delimited, two column lookup table: `ID
   URL` called `guid2url`

Thanks to Debbie Paul for pointing me to a
[Github thread](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc/issues/32#issuecomment-1344768511)
where she asked ChatGPT to parse label text into JSON, and also for
pointing me to the TDWG Slack `#ai` channel, where I see others
([Rod Page](https://twitter.com/rdmpage/status/1642867875424641025),
[Rukaya](https://github.com/gbif-norway/label-classification-gpt))
have also been experimenting.
